    <h2>Beard and mustache trim and servicing</h2>
    <p>While haircuts are certainly the focal point of the barbershop experience, its essential not to neglect facial
      hair services.
      Offering trimming services is just the start — facial hair services should also include oil treatments, shaping,
      and conditioning to keep beard and mustache hair clean and vibrant.
      Many barbershops even offer hot-towel massages to open up the pores and provide a premium luxury treatment.</p>
    <h2>Cuts and fades</h2>
    <p>Mens barbershop services may come and go as tastes change, but the haircut is the foundation of any barbershop
      worth its salt. Haircuts and fades are staples, and barbers should stay on top of the latest styles and trends for
      men and boys to anticipate client needs.
      Of course, client needs will vary — some men embrace the hippie look and keep long hair, while others may want to
      save their entire head — so provide a range of price points depending on the time requirement and complexity of
      the service. And if your barbers
      are exceptionally creative, consider offering customized designs to give your shop a unique hook.</p>
    <h2>Hair coloring and gray blending</h2>
    <p>Whether its a way to mask the gray or simply a way to make a bold statement, hair coloring services for men have
      grown increasingly popular over the years. Barbershops would do well to offer bleaching and hair dye services to
      accommodate their clients. Plus, its easy to set up recurring appointments for a root refresh as hair grows out
      and natural color comes back in.</p>
    <h2>Straight razor shave</h2>
    <p>Straight razor shaving services should be a core, defining offering on the menu of any premium barbershop. Why?
      There are a few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Its a better quality shave:</strong>Unlike standard, off-the-rack razors, a straight razor can shave
        hair
        closer to the root within the skin, providing a sharper, more defined look without the razor burn.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Its hard to do:</strong> Shaving facial hair with a straight razor takes a ton of practice without
        incurring
        nicks or scratches, let alone making it look good. Its a dedicated skill that requires proper training that
        many simply dont have the time or patience to learn.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Its an experience:</strong> Straight razor shaves harken back to a time of rotating barbershop poles,
        sharpening razors with a leather strap, and applying shaving cream with a horsehair brush. Theres a certain
        romantic nostalgia in the straight razor shave, and making it a memorable experience will draw in the curious
        and make them repeat customers.</li>
    </ul>
